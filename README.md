# go cli boilerplate

There are common things I want every cli application to be capable of. And I try to collect these things in this repository.

this includes:
 - understand cli commands and flags
 - display build + version information
 - read and display config
 
 
 ## usage
 
  - clone
  - rm .git
  - replace package name in .go files and Makefile
  - add your things
